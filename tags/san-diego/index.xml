      <description>Santa Ysabel Nature Center Get to know this 7.1-mile loop trail near Julian, California. Generally considered a moderately challenging route, it takes an average of 3 h 6 min to complete. This is a popular trail for hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking, but you can still enjoy some solitude during quieter times of day. The trail is open year-round and is beautiful to visit anytime. Dogs are welcome, but must be on a leash.</description>
